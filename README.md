# TiredTasks
The goal of this project is to develop an app that assists people with chronic pain or illnesses in managing and planning their day.

This app was developed using Android Studio and tested on a Pixel 3 emulator running the R API. To run this app, it can be downloaded and opened in Android Studio, where it can then be run on an emulator or a physical device that has been paired with Android Studio.
